# Game AI Jam RL

Reinforcement learning algorithms for the Game AI Jam project.

## Description

**Dead by RogueLight** is a level-based 2D roguelike game where you play hide-and-seek in a happy courtyard at nighttime with your friends. Your goal is to find all the hiders with your flashlight before they reach the burrow. Remember, if even one hider reaches the burrow, you will lose the level. Playing hide-and-seek at night can be both exciting and challenging!

## AI

The intelligence controlling the hiders is a Neural Network trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The agents have learned to play the game through trial-and-error with no scripted behavior. However, during training, we ensured that they were always beatable and fun. Challenge yourself to beat a Machine Learning-based game AI, leave feedback, and enjoy the game!

## Commands

All commands are displayed on the screen. You can move in all 8 directions and turn your flashlight left and right to find the hiders. When your flashlight battery runs out, you lose the game. Each time you find a hider or lose a game, the red bar will increase. But what happens when it reaches its maximum? Play to find out!

```sh
conda create -n jam python=3.7
